### Factory Design Pattern

##### Simple Factory : Intermediate step of introducing _Factory Method or Abstract Factory pattern_
* The Simple factory pattern describes a class that has **one** creation method with a large conditional logic. Based on method parameters it chooses product class to instantiate and then return. 
* People usually confuse simple factories with general factories or with one of the creational design patterns.

##### Factory Method Pattern
* It defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
