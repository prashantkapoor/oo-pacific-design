### Loose Coupling
* Example: WeatherAPP class and LCDScreen class
  * Classes should not rely on concrete classes(as instance variable) to perform a function. 
  * Changes in internal implementations of concrete class should not cause changes in another class
### Tight Coupling 
  * When changes to one class affect the other class
